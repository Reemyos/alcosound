# AlcoSound üçæ
This is a project I made in a course at the university. The project
description was to use sonification in order to create a new experience.
I chose to use ESP modules to measure the liquid output of a bottle. The
data is then used to directly control the pitch of a track. That way, 
each costumer's drink will contribute a unique sound to the overall music
playing at the bar. In some way, it's making your drink your DJ. I also
added a feature that makes the effect of your drink disappear after a
specified amount of time. The idea is that your drink will effect the music
as long as you're drinking it. But once you're done, your drink will no
longer be a part of the music.
